## 1. Overview & Vision

**PIX2** is an open, human-readable, deterministic Domain Specific Language (DSL) engineered specifically for defining 2D pixel art spritesheets, character cell atlases, palettes, and multi-directional animations as pure structured data.

Unlike raster image formats (PNG, WebP) which store unstructured pixel matrices without semantic awareness, PIX2 treats artwork as an editable, versionable document graph:
- **Deterministic Rendering**: Identical inputs with conforming renderers yield identical pixel outputs.
- **Data-Level Editability**: Coordinates, palettes, frames, and geometric macros are discrete records.
- **Git-Native Versionability**: Line-oriented text enables transparent diffing, branching, and automated PR review of game graphics.
- **AI-Native Authoring**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can reliably reason about coordinates and geometry far more accurately than generating raw uncompressed bytes.

## 2. Independence & Ecosystem Governance

While **NOIRADIX Studio** serves as the initial reference visual editor and suite for PIX2, **PIX2 is governed as an independent standard**. Any engine, game framework, or toolchain (Unity, Godot, Unreal, Aseprite plugins, CLI compilers) can implement conforming parsers and renderers without dependency on NOIRADIX Studio.

## 3. Reference Implementation & Ports

The reference implementation of the PIX2 parser, serializer, and validation engine is provided in JavaScript (`pix2/js/pix2-format.js`).

Developers implementing PIX2 in **Rust, Python, Go, C#, C++, or Zig** must validate their implementations against the normative test vectors located in `pix2/test-vectors/`.

## 4. Licensing & Attribution

PIX2 utilizes a clean dual-licensing model to protect both the standard's open dissemination and the implementation's commercial usability:

- **Specification & Documentation**: Licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International ([CC BY 4.0](LICENSE-SPEC))**.
  - Attribution requirement: *PIX2 Specification created by Nguyen Duc Canh (@dotlinux26).*
- **Reference Compiler & Code**: Licensed under the **Apache License, Version 2.0 ([Apache-2.0](LICENSE-CODE))**.
  - Free for commercial, personal, open-source, and proprietary integration.
