**NOIRADIX Studio** is a pure vanilla, offline-first pixel art editor and animation suite built from the ground up for the `.pix2` semantic text standard. It bridges the gap between AI generation, pixel artists, and modern game engines by providing deterministic sparse-pixel serialization, multi-directional character templates, and game-ready atlas export with anti-bleeding protection.

**Account team:** sign in with ChatGPT and Google, choose account models, and let ChatGPT plan/review while Gemini edits the real Studio canvas. The team shares actual editor feedback and supports one correction pass, permissions, cancellation and usage reporting without API keys. See [account-team setup and limits](docs/ACCOUNT_TEAM.md). Optional API-agent management remains under advanced settings; see [API setup and token audit](docs/AI_MULTI_AGENT.md).

> [!TIP]
> **Looking for standalone 2D pixel painting without animation timelines?**  
> Check out [**NOIRADIX PixelArt**](https://noiradix.me/pixelart/) (`pixelart/index.html`) — our new sibling tool featuring dynamic canvas sizing (16×16 to 512×512), pure 2D illustration tools, a live two-way PIX2 source code editor, and AI prompt studio. See [`docs/PIXELART/`](docs/PIXELART/README.md).

## 💡 The Core Philosophy: Why NOIRADIX & `.pix2` Exist

> **"Let machines write the coordinate math. Let humans enjoy the visual canvas."**

### 1. Nobody Wants to Manually Code Pixels by Hand
Let’s be honest: no human artist or game developer is going to sit down and type thousands of coordinate lines like `pixel 4,5 #ffffff` by hand. That would be tedious and impractical.
* **The `.pix2` text format is designed for Machines & AI (LLMs):** It gives language models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) a clean, symbolic grammar to express sprites with symmetry math and geometry algorithms in seconds.
* **NOIRADIX Studio is designed for Humans:** A visual, tactile workbench where you draw with a mouse or tablet, scrub timelines, test walk cycles, and tweak pixels effortlessly.
* **`.pix2` is the Transparent Bridge:** A human-readable and machine-readable intermediate representation that replaces mysterious, proprietary binary blobs with clean, Git-diffable code.

### 2. Logic-Driven Code Over Blurry Diffusion Models
Most generative AI tools rely on heavy diffusion models that hallucinate anti-aliased, blurry pixels, mismatched eye heights, and distorted palettes that cannot be used in real pixel art games.
* With `.pix2`, an LLM doesn't "hallucinate" pixels; it **computes exact discrete coordinates**:
  ```python
  # Exact bilateral mirror symmetry formula
  x_mirror = width - 1 - x
  ```
* The result is **100% deterministic, crisp, integer-grid pixel art** without expensive GPUs or blurry diffusion artifacts.

> [!NOTE]
> **Output Quality Depends on Model Reasoning & Human Retouching:**  
> `.pix2` guarantees integer coordinates and crisp borders, but **it is not a magical artistic oracle**. The aesthetic quality, anatomical proportion, and color harmony generated by AI are **strictly bounded by the reasoning power of the LLM model** you use (e.g. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro vs. compact lightweight models).  
> Raw AI generation serves as **rapid structural scaffolding and timing draft in seconds**. Turning AI-generated scaffolding into game-ready art **still requires human eyes and artist touch** — fine-tuning palettes, adjusting facial expressions, and adding nuanced pixel details inside NOIRADIX Studio.

### 3. Exclusively Focused on 2D Pixel Art
NOIRADIX Studio does not attempt to be a bloated 1,000-menu painting suite like Photoshop or Aseprite, nor does it dabble in 3D meshes or vector graphics. It is razor-focused on one painful bottleneck:  
👉 **Taking you from an idea or sprite sheet to a fully working, directional walking character inside Unity 2D in 1 click — saving 15 to 20 minutes of tedious manual slicing and animator wiring per character.**

### 4. Clear Boundary: Native Import & Slice vs. Vector Autotracing
A common architectural boundary in NOIRADIX is the distinction between raster slicing and vector autotracing:
* **NOIRADIX does not perform heuristic vector autotracing.** We reject error-prone image-to-vector curve fitting algorithms that smear sharp pixel clusters into distorted Bézier shapes.
* **Native Import & Slice Pipeline (Studio 2.0):** Instead, NOIRADIX Studio 2.0 includes a dedicated, mathematically exact **Import & Slice Pipeline** for raster images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`) and atlas metadata (`TexturePacker` JSON Hash/Array, `Aseprite` JSON, Uniform Grid):
  - **1:1 Discrete Pixel Ingestion:** Slices raster frames directly into discrete `.pix2` cell frames with 100% color fidelity and pure alpha transparency.
  - **Structural Layer Preservation:** Slices can be routed into dedicated structural layers (`@layer`) and named regions (`@region`).
  - **Automated Clip Assembly:** Parses atlas animation sequences, frame tags, and frame rates directly into working playback clips without manual re-linking.
  - **Import Code (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>):** Dedicated instant modal for pasting raw `.pix2` DSL code generated by AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini).

## 💎 The Strategic Edge: "Sprite as Structured Data" (SaaD)

Traditional tools treat sprites as opaque raster bitmaps (PNGs). NOIRADIX establishes an entirely different paradigm: **Sprite as Structured Data**.  
We do not attempt to out-compete monolithic 1,000-feature drawing apps on brush plugins. Instead, we solve how 2D game artwork is **represented, programmatically manipulated, versioned, and repurposed**:

```
[ Human Artists ] ── (Visual Touch & Polish) ──┐
                                               ▼
[ AI Models ]    ── (Coordinate Logic)   ──► [ .pix2 DSL ] ──► [ Game Engines (Unity / Godot) ]
                                            (Structured Data)   (1-Click Native Clips & Atlas)
```

### The 5 Architectural Pillars of `.pix2`:

1. **Deterministic Rendering:**  
   The same `.pix2` document and specification version will produce the exact same pixel matrix across every machine and renderer. Regenerating or tweaking code never introduces random pixel mutations, eye shifts, or blurred outlines.
2. **Data-Level Editability:**  
   Artwork can be modified programmatically at the coordinate, palette, or cell layer. Instead of repainting 32 individual frames by hand, software agents or scripts can re-index palette IDs, adjust symmetry axes, or swap weapon attachments with mathematical precision.
3. **Modular Reusability:**  
   A base character skeleton can effortlessly generate dozens of equipment overlays, armor variations, or directional walk cycles without redrawing the baseline artwork from scratch.
4. **Ecosystem Interoperability:**  
   Because `.pix2` is an open, human-readable specification, any toolchain, pipeline script, or game engine in Python, C#, Rust, or JavaScript can easily build custom parsers, validators, procedural generators, and automated CI importers.
5. **Git-Native Versionability:**  
   Sprites cease to be opaque binary blobs polluting Git repositories and Git LFS. Every single visual change is a clean text diff that can be reviewed in GitHub Pull Requests, branched, merged, and safely rolled back.

| **Tier 1 — Full Native (Recommended)** | **Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, Arc, Vivaldi** | **v86+** (Chromium engine) | ✅ Yes (Direct write via `createWritable()`, zero popups) | ✅ Yes (Binds `FileSystemFileHandle` on drop) | ✅ Yes (Live auto-reload on external file edits) | **Optimal (100% Desktop-Grade Experience)** |
| **Tier 2 — Graceful Fallback** | **Mozilla Firefox** | **v90+** (Gecko engine) | 🔄 Fallback (Triggers direct file download) | 🔄 Fallback (In-Memory Draft) | ⚠️ Manual Only (Click reload button or `Ctrl+Shift+R`) | **Fully Supported (Lossless Web Fallback)** |
| **Tier 2 — Graceful Fallback** | **Apple Safari** (macOS, iPadOS, iOS) | **v15.2+** (WebKit engine) | 🔄 Fallback (Triggers direct file download) | 🔄 Fallback (In-Memory Draft) | ⚠️ Manual Only (Click reload button or `Ctrl+Shift+R`) | **Fully Supported (Lossless Web Fallback)** |

> [!TIP]
> **Why Chromium is Recommended:** Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera implement the **File System Access API** (`window.showOpenFilePicker`, `showSaveFilePicker`, and `DataTransferItem.getAsFileSystemHandle()`). This unlocks instant `Ctrl+S` disk commits, drag-and-drop linking, and real-time external change detection when working alongside external AI coding assistants or VS Code. In Firefox and Safari, the studio gracefully falls back to lossless HTML5 file downloads with zero data loss.

## 🎮 Other Game Engine Targets

### Godot 4
1. Select **TexturePacker Standard (JSON Hash)** in the Export dialog.
2. Drop the generated `.png` and `.json` files into your Godot project.
3. Import into an `AnimatedSprite2D` or use a standard AtlasTexture resource.

### Phaser / Pixi.js / WebGL
Load the exported atlas directly using the standard Phaser atlas loader:
```javascript
this.load.atlas('player', 'assets/player_atlas.png', 'assets/player.json');
```

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

Run the automated test suites using Node.js (134 tests, zero external npm dependencies):
```bash
# 1. Semantic roundtrip & feature tests (96/96)
node tests/test-roundtrip.js

# 2. Malicious payload & anti-DoS defenses (20/20)
node tests/test-security.js

# 3. TextMate regex pattern & capture group checks (6/6)
node tests/test-tmLanguage.js

# 4. Normative test vector conformance (11/11)
node tests/test-vectors-conformance.js
```

Verify JavaScript engine syntax across root and standalone packages:
```bash
node --check js/app.js
node --check js/pix2-format.js
node --check js/editor-state.js
node --check js/animation-player.js
node --check js/tools.js
node --check pix2/js/pix2-format.js
```
