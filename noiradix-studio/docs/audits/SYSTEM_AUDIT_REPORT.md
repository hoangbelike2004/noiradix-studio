---

## 1. Executive Summary & Scope

A rigorous, exhaustive system verification was conducted across all subsystems of NOIRADIX Studio. The audit evaluated:
1. **Tooling & Viewport Mechanics:** Pan/Hand Tool (`H`), 360° unrestricted workspace panning, analytical cursor-anchored zooming.
2. **UX & Context Menu System:** Focus-preserved context menu invocation anywhere on the Grid Overview surface.
3. **Canvas & Component Styling:** Elimination of redundant strokes on Row Cards and Column Headers; preservation of sprite grid borders.
4. **Data Integrity & Non-Destructive Operations:** Row reordering, row deletion/duplication, bounds resizing, safe animation assignment.
5. **Security & Resilience:** Prototype pollution defenses, resource exhaustion/DoS protections, and offline-first compliance.

## 2. Logic & Domain Correctness

### 2.1 Hand / Pan Tool (`data-tool="pan"`, Shortcut `H`)
* **Toolbar Registration:** Single, canonical 4-directional arrow tool button (`<i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-alt"></i>`) positioned below the Selection Marquee.
* **Shortcut Binding:** Pressing key `H` activates `selectTool('pan')`.
* **State Management:**
  * Status bar displays `Tool: PAN`.
  * Pointer cursor transitions to `grab` over the workspace, and `grabbing` during active drag.
  * Drawing events (`handleCellMouseDown`) immediately abort if `state.currentTool === 'pan'`, ensuring zero accidental pixel writes.
* **Free 360° Panning:**
  * Operates via hardware-accelerated transform offsets (`translate(panX, panY)`).
  * Unlike native container scrolling, panning is **unrestricted** even when the artwork is smaller than the viewport.
  * Reset to dead-center is achieved instantly via `Ctrl + 0` or double-clicking the Pan tool button (`centerCellCanvas()`).

### 2.2 Analytical Cursor-Anchored Mouse Wheel Zoom
* **Mathematical Invariance:**
  Given viewport center, unscaled mouse coordinates $(u_x, u_y)$, and zoom step from $z_{\text{old}}$ to $z_{\text{new}}$:
  $$\Delta W = \frac{cw \cdot (z_{\text{new}} - z_{\text{old}})}{2}$$
  $$\text{Shift}_x = u_x \cdot (z_{\text{new}} - z_{\text{old}})$$
  $$\text{panX}_{\text{new}} = \text{panX}_{\text{old}} + (\Delta W - \text{Shift}_x)$$
* **Verification:** The on-screen position of the pixel under the cursor remains invariant down to sub-pixel precision across continuous zoom operations. Tested across arbitrary interior and edge points ($x = 0, 3, 7.5, 11, 15, 16$).

### 2.3 Grid Overview Context Menu (Focus-Preserved Triggering)
* **Problem Addressed:** Previously, right-clicking outside the exact bounding box of a cell opened the default browser context menu.
* **Resolution:**
  * When right-clicking on a specific cell: focuses that cell and opens the Studio Context Menu.
  * When right-clicking anywhere on the empty grid canvas, margins, or viewport: resolves the currently selected cell (`selectedGridCellId`) and opens the context menu at the cursor position.
  * Default browser context menu is suppressed across the entire grid canvas viewport.

### 2.4 UI Component Polish (Border Stroke Elimination)
* **Row Cards:** Removed hard outline strokes (`#94a3b8` / `#4b5563`), transitioning to clean, borderless cards with intact rounded geometry, crisp labels, and action buttons (`[▲] [▼] [clone] [×]`).
* **Column Headers:** Removed outline strokes, leaving high-contrast, borderless pill badges with column delete buttons.
* **Cell Artworks:** Sprite cell borders and pixel grid lines remain 100% intact as required.

### 2.5 Floating Animation Studio Ergonomics & Narrow Profile
* **Narrow Panel Architecture:** Relocated the animation clip selector and direction mode dropdowns down into `.anim-panel-body`, allowing the entire floating panel width to contract from `380px` to a compact `236px`.
* **Lightweight Playback Row:** Eliminated the cramped FPS slider from the floating preview, creating a clean, symmetrical 3-button playback control row (`[Previous] [Play/Pause] [Next]`).
* **Enlarged Preview & Integer Scaling:** Expanded `.anim-canvas-wrapper` from `112px` to `192px` (290% area increase). Sized preview to default `8×` (128px for 16×16 sprites) with dedicated zoom pills (`4×`, `6×`, `8×`, `10×`, `Fit`), wheel zoom, and double-click toggle.

### 2.6 Grid Overview 360° Free Panning (Hand-like Dragging Without Key H)
* **Zero-Key Requirement:** Clicking and dragging anywhere on the empty canvas margins or on `.grid-canvas-viewport` initiates free 360° canvas panning without needing to switch tools or press shortcut `H`.
* **Hit-Testing Separation:** Mutually exclusive routing cleanly differentiates button clicks, row card drag reordering, cell selection clicks, and background panning.
* **Tactile Feedback:** Empty spaces display cursor `grab`, actively dragging displays `grabbing`, and cell targets display `pointer`.
* **Instant Re-center:** Double-clicking the viewport background or pressing `Ctrl + 0` instantly resets `gridPanX = 0, gridPanY = 0`.

### 2.7 Export Atlas Live Preview Magnifying Zoom Controls
* **Magnifying Glass Controls:** Added zoom pills (`1×`, `2×`, `4×`, `Fit`) to the Atlas Live Preview header.
* **Crisp Nearest-Neighbor Scaling:** Preview defaults to `4×` zoom ($276\text{px}$ for a $69\text{px}$ atlas) with mouse-wheel zoom support and double-click toggle, allowing artists to closely inspect pixel bleeding and spacing margins.

## 3. Data Integrity & Safety

| Operation | Risk Analyzed | Mitigation Implemented | Verification Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Row Drag Reorder** | Pixel overwriting / index desync | Normalized `grid_pos` re-indexing with atomic cell reassignment | Pass (Test 6) |
| **Animation Assignment** | Canvas cells turning blank | `assignRowToAnimation` preserves all cell pixel maps without re-initialization | Pass (Test 6) |
| **Canvas Expansion** | Artwork cropping on dimension change | Non-destructive pixel offset retention via `PIX2.resizeCells(doc, w, h, 'expand')` | Pass (Manual + Test 5) |
| **Disk Autosave** | Status desynchronization | Top Autosave pill and bottom Status Bar badge synchronized via atomic snapshot | Pass (Commit `7e4bd6c`) |

## 4. Security & Vulnerability Analysis

### 4.1 Prototype Pollution Protection
* **Attack Vectors:** Malicious `@cell __proto__`, `@palette __proto__`, `@animation constructor`.
* **Defense:** Sanitization filter checks all keys against `FORBIDDEN_KEYS = new Set(['__proto__', 'constructor', 'prototype'])`.
* **Result:** Rejects pollution attempts without altering `Object.prototype`.

### 4.2 Denial of Service (Anti-DoS) & Resource Clamping
* **Dimensions:** Clamped to `MAX_GRID_COLS = 128`, `MAX_GRID_ROWS = 256`, `MAX_CELL_DIM = 512`.
* **Algorithms:**
  * Bresenham Line Tool clamped to max step limits to prevent infinite loops.
  * Flood Fill BFS bounded by `Math.min(65536, w * h * 4)` queue steps to prevent stack overflow and memory exhaustion.
* **Coordinate Bounds:** Coordinates $|x|, |y| > 2048$ are strictly discarded.

### 4.3 Offline-First Architecture
* Pure Vanilla Web Stack (HTML5, CSS3, ES6+).
* Zero runtime npm dependencies.
* Zero build steps or external bundler requirements.
* Embedded FontAwesome assets provide offline icon rendering.
