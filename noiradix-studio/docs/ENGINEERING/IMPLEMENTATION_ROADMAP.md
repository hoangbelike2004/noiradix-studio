# NOIRADIX Studio — Issues, Decisions & Engineering Roadmap

**Document Reference:** `docs/ENGINEERING/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`  
**Last Updated:** 2026-11-07  
**Status:** Phase 5: Total Feature Freeze & PIX2 v1.0 Specification Release (CLOSED)

## 1. Resolved Issues & Verified Fixes

| Issue ID | Severity | Description | Resolution Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BUG-01** | **P0** | Lexer treated `#` in `#RRGGBB` colors as comment delimiters when followed by trailing comment. | **FIXED:** Strict comment parser: `;` is primary comment token; `#` is treated as comment only if preceded by whitespace and not a hex code. |
| **BUG-02** | **P0** | `normalizeHex` truncated 8-character `#RRGGBBAA` hex codes down to 7 characters, destroying alpha transparency. | **FIXED:** Supported `#RGB`, `#RGBA`, `#RRGGBB`, and `#RRGGBBAA`. Alpha values preserved from 0 to 255. |
| **BUG-03** | **P0** | Grid slicing naive `img.width / 4` ignored inter-cell gap (1px) in `Player.png` (67x67 with 16x16 cells). | **FIXED:** Integrated configurable `gap`, `margin`, and `cellSize` parameters. |
| **BUG-04** | **P1** | Round playback buttons (`.icon-round-btn`, `.play-btn`) stretched into tall ovals due to flexbox line-height. | **FIXED:** Enforced `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1 !important; flex-shrink: 0 !important; width: 32px; height: 32px;`. |
| **BUG-05** | **P1** | Rulers disconnected from canvas, sitting at viewport top-left while canvas floated in center. | **FIXED:** Integrated `.canvas-container-with-rulers` wrapping directly around `.canvas-stack`. |
| **BUG-06** | **P1** | Hardcoded pitch black `#12131b` tab bar and status bar caused jarring dark patches in Light Mode. | **FIXED:** Bound all UI elements to CSS theme variables (`--bg-secondary`, `--tab-bar-bg`, `--statusbar-bg`). |

## 2. Completed User Feedback & Implemented Solutions (P0 / P1)

### Issue A: Smashed / Overlapping Grid Column Headers ("vỡ đồ họa nè dính nè")
- **Cause:** `Col 0 (Frame 0)` text in canvas header was wider (~85px) than column slot width ($16 \times 3 + 16 = 64\text{px}$), causing adjacent column titles to collide and overlap.
- **Resolution:** [RESOLVED & IMPLEMENTED]
  1. Replaced with compact badges: `Col 0`, `Col 1` with centered spacing.
  2. Increased inter-cell column gap to 24px in Grid Overview so text never collides.
  3. Added interactive inline editing and renaming for Row and Column labels.

### Issue B: Custom Animation Management & Unlocking 4-Dir Restriction
- **Feedback:** Need flexible panel to add/edit/delete rows, columns, and custom animations beyond standard 4 directions.
- **Resolution:** [RESOLVED & IMPLEMENTED]
  1. Unbound animations from fixed 4-directional rows to arbitrary named clips (`walk_down`, `attack`, `jump`, `death`, `idle`).
  2. Integrated dedicated **Animation Manager Panel** in Grid Inspector: create, rename, delete clips, and reorder frames.
  3. Floating Animation Studio & workspace dropdown supports previewing all animations with live FPS and looping controls.

### Issue C: Dedicated Animation Workspace / Screen ("chế độ màn hình xem chuyên biệt")
- **Feedback:** Need dedicated screen mode for full animation authoring and timeline scrubbing.
- **Resolution:** [RESOLVED & IMPLEMENTED]
  1. Added dedicated top-level **[🎬 Animation Studio]** (`#view-animation-studio`) tab alongside Grid Overview, Cell Editor, and Code & AI.
  2. Integrated centered animation canvas with dynamic zoom (up to 25x auto-fit).
  3. Built horizontal frame timeline strip with thumbnails, duplicate/delete controls, and onion skinning ghosting.

### Issue D: Full Keyboard Shortcuts Suite
- **Feedback:** Professional pixel artists require single-key shortcuts and canvas navigation.
- **Resolution:** [RESOLVED & IMPLEMENTED]
  Implemented full shortcut suite: `Alt + Wheel` / `Wheel` (anchor zoom), `Space + Drag` (canvas pan), `V` (Select), `B` (Pencil), `E` (Eraser), `G` (Bucket), `I` (Eyedropper), `L` (Line), `U` (Rect), `S` (Symmetry), `X` (Swap colors), `D` (Reset colors), `Ctrl + 0` (Reset view), `Ctrl + Z` (Undo), `Ctrl + Y` (Redo).

### Issue E: Grid Row & Column Management
- **Feedback:** Allow dynamic row and column addition/removal on canvas.
- **Resolution:** [RESOLVED & IMPLEMENTED]
  Added interactive `[+ Add Row]`, `[- Remove Row]`, `[+ Add Col]`, `[- Remove Col]` controls, row renaming, and cell-to-animation bindings.

## 4. Final Milestone: Phase 5 Total Feature Freeze & v1.0 Specification Release (CLOSED)

- **NOIRADIX Studio Application:** Total Feature Freeze. Active development closed. Enters maintenance-only mode (bug fixes, security patches).
- **PIX2 Reference Engine:** Frozen (Production v1.0). Fully verified against normative test vectors.
- **PIX2 v1.0 Standard:** Frozen v1.0 Standard Specification (Production Ready). EBNF, lexical grammar, drawing primitives semantics, and test vector baselines are fully decoupled, immutable, normative, and synchronized.
- **Acceptance Status:** 134/134 tests passing cleanly in continuous integration.

## 5. Ecosystem Sibling: NOIRADIX PixelArt (`noiradix.me/pixelart/`)

- **Role:** Dedicated standalone 2D pixel art painting environment and live bi-directional PIX2 source code editor.
- **Governance:** Does NOT modify or unfreeze NOIRADIX Studio or the PIX2 v1.0 Standard. Reuses the frozen `js/pix2-format.js` reference engine without alteration.
- **Documentation:** Full architectural reuse plan and technical specifications documented in [`docs/PIXELART/ARCHITECTURE_AND_REUSE_PLAN.md`](../PIXELART/ARCHITECTURE_AND_REUSE_PLAN.md) and [`docs/PIXELART/SPECIFICATION.md`](../PIXELART/SPECIFICATION.md).
