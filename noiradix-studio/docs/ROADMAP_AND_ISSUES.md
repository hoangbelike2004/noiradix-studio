## 1. Issue & Bug Tracking Matrix

| ID | Priority | Module | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **BUG-02** | **P0** | Engine | `normalizeHex` stripped alpha channel from `#RRGGBBAA`. | **RESOLVED & VERIFIED** (Full RGBA 0-255 preserved) |
| **BUG-03** | **P0** | Engine | PNG slicing assumed 0 gap, corrupting 16x16 cells in `Player.png` (67x67 with 1px gap). | **RESOLVED & VERIFIED** (Configurable gap & alpha) |
| **BUG-04** | **P1** | UI | Circular buttons (`.icon-round-btn`) stretched into ovals due to flexbox font line-height. | **RESOLVED & VERIFIED** (`aspect-ratio: 1/1 !important`) |

| **BUG-07** | **P1** | Engine | Cell IDs rigidly hardcoded to `cell_r_c` preventing custom naming like `ghost_idle`. | **RESOLVED & VERIFIED** (Decoupled identity from grid pos) |
| **BUG-08** | **P1** | Studio | Animation player locked to 4 directional walk rows only. | **RESOLVED & VERIFIED** (Supports arbitrary custom clips) |
| **BUG-09** | **P1** | Studio | Single-cell selection (`1×1`) deselected immediately due to identical min/max check. | **RESOLVED & VERIFIED** (Single-pixel marquee retained) |
| **BUG-10** | **P1** | UI | Selection marquee appeared jagged/blurry at high zoom due to subpixel dashes. | **RESOLVED & VERIFIED** (Crisp solid outline + inner glow) |
| **FEAT-01**| **P1** | Studio | Dedicated Animation Studio Tab with visual timeline strip & Onion Skin. | **IMPLEMENTED** (`#view-anim-studio`) |
| **FEAT-02**| **P1** | Engine | Anchor-centered zoom on mouse hover pixel / selection. | **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED** (Invariance math) |
| **FEAT-03**| **P1** | File | Desktop-like File Management (File System Access API `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+O`). | **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED** (Native + Fallback) |
| **FEAT-04**| **P1** | State | Dual Autosave (30s time + 1.5s event) with crash recovery snapshot. | **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED** (IndexedDB / LocalStorage) |
| **FEAT-05**| **P1** | Tools | Marquee & Full-Canvas 90° Clockwise Rotation (`R` key and Rotate button). | **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED** (Studio & PixelArt) |
| **FEAT-06**| **P1** | Editor | Safe View Only lock and direct code editing toggle with Apply button. | **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED** (ReadOnly protection) |
| **FEAT-07**| **P1** | Canvas | Alignment guidelines (Center crosshairs, Vertical guide, Horizontal guide). | **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED** (Pixel-crisp cyan lines) |
| **FEAT-08**| **P2** | UI | Universal horizontal drag-scroll across all horizontal toolbars and statusbars. | **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED** (Grabbing cursor interaction) |

## 2. Open Source & Community Strategy

### Licensing Separation
- **NOIRADIX Studio (Editor Application):** **Apache 2.0 License** (permits indie & commercial game development without friction).
- **PIX2 Language Specification:** **CC BY 4.0** (Open standard for any tool, AI agent, or engine to implement).
- **Core Engine & Parsers:** **Apache 2.0 License** (encourages SDK integration in Python, Rust, Godot, Unity).
- **Wisplings Art Assets:** Proprietary / Custom game license.

### Funding & Community Support (Donations)
Rather than locking core pixel tools behind paywalls, PIX2 adopts a transparent donation model:
1. **GitHub Sponsors (Priority 1):** Official repository sponsor tiers (\$2 Supporter, \$5 Pixel Backer, \$10 Studio Sponsor, \$25 Game Dev Patron).
2. **Ko-fi (Priority 2):** Quick tip jar with 0% platform fee on one-off donations.
3. **Open Collective:** For long-term transparent community funds once multiple maintainers join.

### Distribution Channels
1. **GitHub Repository:** Public source code, README with live GIFs, formal specifications, and issue tracking.
2. **itch.io:** Free portable download (standalone HTML/JS bundle) targeting indie game developers.
3. **Web Hosted Edition:** Zero-install instant editor accessible at official domain or GitHub Pages.
4. **Community Outreach:** Showcasing structured pixel editing vs raster diffusion on Reddit (`r/PixelArt`, `r/gamedev`, `r/IndieDev`).
